# My research focuses on:

1. **Interplay of genetics and transcription.** The interplay of genetic alterations and gene expression states in tumors and host tissues throughout cancer evolution. 
<br><br>

2. **Cellular interactions and tissue organization.** Studying the roles of interaction effects in oncogenesis and tumor evolution.
