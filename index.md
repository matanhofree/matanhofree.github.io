title: Cancer Interactomics 
subtitle: Research and thoughts on cancer biology and computational approaches for the study of tumor evolution
---

Recent evidence shows the interactions between tumor and host play a key role in response to therapy and outcome. I am interested in understanding the evolution of malignancy and oncogenic processes through a holistic examination of cancer at the tissue and patient level. My research focuses on cancer-interactomics â€“ the study of interaction effects across spatial and temporal scales within tumors and between tumor and microenvironment. I use methods and ideas from systems biology, graph theory, machine learning and statistics to develop novel computational tool and analysis methods. I approach biological questions from a data driven approach, combining systematic knowledge, and multi-model high-dimensional measurements to address fundamental questions.
