I am a visiting scientist at The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and The Weizmann Institute of Rehovot. Over the past year I have been tele-commuting to work at the Broad with the research teams of Prof. Nir Hacohen and Dr. Marios Giannakis. At the Weizmann, I have been graciously hosted by the lab of Dr. Moshe Biton of the Department of Biological Regulation.

I was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Prof. Aviv Regev, and the Klarman Cell Observatory at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. I was a briefly a postdoc with Prof. Levi Garraway, prior to his leaving to industry, at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. I earned my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science of UC San Diego, working under the supervision of Prof. Trey Ideker of the Department of Medicine at UC San Diego. I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Computational Biology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in Israel.
